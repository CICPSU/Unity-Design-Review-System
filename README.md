# Unity-Design-Review-System
OVERVIEW
This repository contains a Unity project that aims to support the development of building design review/walkthrough models. 
The project contains the following features:
1. Animated avatar with integration of xbox controller.
2. Minimap system
3. Location bookmark system
4. Display configuration system that enables correct 1 to 1 scale output mapping for any system with any number of flat displays. (similar to MiddleVR)
5. Assets that enables adding new characters into scene during run time. The added characters can perform AI path finding if Nav Mesh is baked into scene.
6. More are under development.

HOW TO USE:
We recommend downloading the project and load your model into the "Template Scene", because we have configured that scene for best rendering quality and easiest use.
You can also export the Full Package folder as a Unitypackage and import into your own project. This will require you to set up your input manager accordingly. Or you can go to the project settings folder and copy the InputManager.asset into your new project.
