=======================
#Additional Info#
=======================
### How do I get set up? ###
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.

### Contribution guidelines ###
Got a script you want added, then just fork and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)
Just ensure 
* The header of the script matches the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)

### License ###
All scripts conform to the BSD license and are free to use / distribute.  See the [LICENSE](https://bitbucket.org/ddreaper/unity-ui-extensions/src/6d03f25b0150994afa97c6a55854d6ae696cad13/LICENSE?at=default) file for more information 

### Like what you see? ###
All these scripts were put together for my latest book Unity3D UI Essentials
Check out the [page on my blog](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials) for more details and learn all about the inner workings of the new Unity UI System.

### The downloads ###
As this repo was created to support my new Unity UI Title ["Unity 3D UI Essentials"](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials), in the downloads section you will find two custom assets (SpaceShip-DemoScene-Start.unitypackage and RollABallSample-Start.unitypackage).  These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.

I will add more sample scenes for the UI examples in this repository and detail them above over time.
